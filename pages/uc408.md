## Overview

![](/images/vla.jpg)
This course is an overview of concepts and techniques used in the transmission of electromagnetic energy at radio and microwave frequencies. The course is intended for graduate students working in areas of microwave to millimeter-wave detectors and high speed electronics. The course begins with an overview electromagnetic theory covering the equivalence principle, the induction theorem, and reciprocity. Wave propagation with guided structures and antennae is discussed in detail. Additional topics in active and passive microwave devices, and communication concepts such as signal modulation and band limited white noise are also discussed
